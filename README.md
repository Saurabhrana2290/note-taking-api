# Note Taking Project
This is the note taking application built in Express.js

## Steps To Setup On Local

We should have node installed on our system.

Then we go to any directory and create our project for example note-taking-api in our case.


### Initialize Project : 
 The npm init -y command sets up a basic package.json file, which will track     your project's dependencies and configuration.

### Install Dependencies:
#### express
